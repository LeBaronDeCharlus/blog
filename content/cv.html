# Some infos about me #
#######################
> aboutme()
    Hello !
    I'm a nice guy (that's what my mother says) who likes to learn from others and help make the world a better place. 
    I like to feel useful and participate in making people happy.
    Important thing to know, I'm always smiling.
    
    I have been working in the IT world for over six years now. What great human and technical adventures! 
    I have worked for large groups, small structures, startups, with people living less than a kilometre from my home… and on other continents! 
    I really enjoy learning from different cultures and share knowledge and anecdotes with my colleagues.
    Happiness is an essential part of my daily life and my job.
    
    And to talk less about work, I have a little cat, his name is "Herr Ludwig Van Chacha" (be precise, he is easily offended) !
    My wife is on the road to be psychologist and I'm really proud of her.
    I love sports, listening to music, discovering the world, eating well and cinema !
    
    I look forward to meeting you :)
