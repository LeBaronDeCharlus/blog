I’m systems engineer and acting for opensource digital world, I love technologies, especially when they include environment issues. Digital industry is not the best regarding green impact and behavior, I think it’s my duty to work and carry values of change.

I have a great interest in cultural things. I like music (classical, jazz, metal), (good & bad) movies, French and international literature.
I look forward to meeting you :)
