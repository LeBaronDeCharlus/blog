&lt;p>This is the case with Galera clustering (mariaDB/mysql). Zabbix (&amp;amp;co) offered me simple solutions for single database servers, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a really interesting template for monitoring a Galera cluster for production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So several questions, what to monitor, how to alert, what&amp;rsquo;s the best method?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I based myself on &lt;a href="http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/monitoringthecluster.html">the official Galera documentation&lt;/a> to have all the important elements to monitor.
For the choice of the Golang language, it seemed to me that it provided me with the necessary functionalities.
As for the choice of alerting, I decided to use a Slack App.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Event Watcher Manager Python3</title><link>https://lebaron.sh/p/event-watcher-manager-python3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 12:53:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lebaron.sh/p/event-watcher-manager-python3/</guid><description>&lt;p>On one specific request, I had to work on the elaboration of an automating program reacting on SFTP users updates.&lt;br>
The main technical issue of this request is that the SFTP protocol does not have a logging system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had heard about &lt;a href="https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify/blob/master/python3/pyinotify.py">the pyinotify library&lt;/a> so I started working on it.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>The project is presented in its primary mechanism&lt;/strong>, for more details, I invite you to read the sources.&lt;/p>

&lt;/u>Details of the context of realization :&lt;/u>.&lt;br>
The program must monitor SFTP user actions. These users have their HomeDir which are NFS mounts.&lt;br>
The user can upload anything to his account, but the program must detect video uploads (in some formats) and then perform a series of successive actions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
